// This is an example for the Big O Notation, whihc is an asymtopic analysis. 

// Asymtopic Analysis: Is the study of an algorithm's efficiency as the input size grows toward infinity, such as that when we do a for loop, it will be a O(n) because we have our input size that will grow infinitely larger as we add n such as  n = 2,
